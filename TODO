- Install scripts:
    - st ( terminal emulator ) 
    -- libx11 (XQuartz on osx )
    -- libxft
    - vim
    - curl
    - tmux

- Custom tmux status line

- tmux scroll keybindings like vim
- longterm & shortterm bash function so that i can switch between longversion and short (user: ~/path: master $, or just $ )
- window number in tabline are hidden cause they dont have a color

When installing ncurses library, might need sudo to be able to install the database files, or maybe find a way to have a path for those ? ( try on a system without curses preinstalled)

The way i compile tmux, it uses ncurses without wide char

i have to link libncurses.a -> libcurses.a .... maybe the other curses libs too (tmux)?

look at cdk cursess dev kit , it has widgets

When install script is ran, print what was installed , download and not done at all
