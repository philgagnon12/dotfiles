- Install scripts:
    - st ( terminal emulator ) 
    -- libx11 (XQuartz on osx )
    -- libxft
    - vim
    - curl

- Custom tmux status line

- tmux scroll keybindings like vim

When installing ncurses library, might need sudo to be able to install the database files, or maybe find a way to have a path for those ? ( try on a system without curses preinstalled)

** tmux **
 - The way i compile tmux, it uses ncurses without wide char
 - when installing tmux in my home bin dir , it creates a share folder for the man pages, tell man to use those 

i have to link libncurses.a -> libcurses.a .... maybe the other curses libs too (tmux)?

look at cdk cursess dev kit , it has widgets

When install script is ran, print what was installed , download and not done at all
